The patient was intubated and it was felt that she should be observed to see if the airway would improve upon which she could be extubated. If not she would require tracheostomy. The patient was treated with IV antibiotics and ventilatory support and at the time of this dictation, she has recently been taken to the operating room where it was felt that the airway sufficient and she was extubated. She was doing well with good p.o.s, good airway, good voice, and desiring to be discharged home. So, the patient is being prepared for discharge at this point. We will have Dr. X evaluate her before she leaves to make sure I do not have any problem with her going home. Dr. Y feels she could be discharged today and will have her return to see him in a week."
