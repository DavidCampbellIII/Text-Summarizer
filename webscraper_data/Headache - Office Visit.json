On general exam she has an area of tenderness on palpation in the left parietal region of her scalp. Neurological exam is detailed on our H&P form. Her neurological exam is within normal limits.",
    "Impression And Plan": "For her headaches we are going to titrate Zonegran up to 200 mg q.h.s. to try to maximize the Zonegran therapy. If this is not effective, when she comes back on August 7, 2006 we will then consider other anticonvulsants such as Neurontin or Lyrica. We also discussed with Ms. Hawkins the possibility of nerve block injection; however, at this point she is not interested.\nShe will be seeing Dr. XYZ for her neuropathies.\nWe made an appointment in endocrine clinic today for a counseling in terms of better diabetes control and she is responsible for trying to get her referral from her primary care physician to go for this consult."
