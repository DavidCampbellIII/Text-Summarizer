    "Assessment": "1. Peripheral neuropathy primarily of the right foot.\n2. Hypertension.\n3. Hypothyroidism.\n4. Essential thrombocythemia.\n5. Allergic rhinitis.\n6. Insomnia.",
    "Plan": "I prescribed Neurontin 100 mg dispensed 30 with five refills one to two p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. peripheral neuropathy. I offered Anodyne physical therapy, but she was not interested yet at this point. I suspect that her peripheral neuropathy may be due to her essential thrombocythemia. We did send her to lab for a CBC due to her anemia and essential thrombocythemia and she needs sed rate due to her peripheral neuropathy, ferritin due to her anemia, and Hemoccult cards x 3 due to anemia. She needs a DT immunization. Recheck with me in about three months. I refilled her Ambien 5 mg at h.s. for one year. She may get a flu shot next month."
