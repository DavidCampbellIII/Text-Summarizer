At time of discharge, she was really feeling back to normal.\n2. Depression and anxiety with history of panic attacks exacerbated by her husband leaving her 2 weeks ago. We discussed this. Also, discussed the situation with a psychiatrist who is available on Friday and I discussed the situation with the patient. In regards to her medications, we are discontinuing the Prozac and she is being reevaluated by Dr. X on Monday or Tuesday. Cymbalta has been recommended as a good alternative medication for her. The patient does have a counselor. It is going to be difficult for her to go home alone. I discussed the resources with her. She has a daughter who will be coming to town in a couple of weeks, but she does have a friend that she can call and stay the next few days with.\n3. Hypertension.
