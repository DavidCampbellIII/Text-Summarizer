Her urine was 3+ ketones, 2+ protein, and 1+ esterase, and rbc too numerous to count with moderate amount of bacteria. H and H stable at 14.1 and 48.7. She was then admitted after giving some Phenergan and Zofran IV. As started on IV, given hydration as well as given a dose of Rocephin to treat bladder infection. She was admitted overnight, nausea and vomiting resolved to only one episode of vomiting after receiving Maalox, tolerated fluids as well as p.o. food.
