    "Restraints": "None. The patient has declined use of chair check and bed check.",
    "Interval History": "Overall, the patient has been doing reasonably well. She is being treated for some hemorrhoids, which are not painful for her. There has been a note that she is constipated.\nHer blood glucoses have been running reasonably well in the morning, perhaps a bit on the high side with the highest of 188. I see a couple in the 150s. However, I also see one that is in the one teens and a couple in the 120s range.\nShe is not bothered by cough or rib pain. These are complaints, which I often hear about.\nToday, I reviewed Dr. Hudyncia's note from psychiatry. Depression responded very well to Cymbalta, and the plan is to continue it probably for a minimum of 1 year.\nShe is not having problems with breathing. No neurologic complaints or troubles. Pain is generally well managed just with Tylenol.",
    "Physical Examination": "Vitals: As in chart. The patient is pleasant and cooperative. She is in no apparent distress. Her lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion. Heart sounds regular to me. Abdomen: Soft. Extremities without any edema. At the rectum, she has a couple of large hemorrhoids, which are not thrombosed and are not tender.",
    "Assessment And Plan": "1. Hypertension, good control, continue current.\n2. Depression, well treated on Cymbalta. Continue.\n3. Other issues seem to be doing pretty well. These include blood pressure, which is well controlled. We will continue the medicines. She is clinically euthyroid. We check that occasionally. Continue Tylenol.\n4. For the bowels, I will increase the intensity of regimen there. I have a feeling she would not tolerate either the FiberCon tablets or Metamucil powder in a drink. I will try her on annulose and see how she does with that."
