    "Assessment And Plan": "1. Intractable nausea and vomiting/history of diabetic gastroparesis/multiple endoscopies revealing gastritis and esophagitis. We will make the patient NPO for now. IV fluids. Give antiemetics as needed. She will be continued on Reglan 10 mg IV every 6 hours and she will be started on erythromycin 250 mg orally 3 times a day to help increase peristalsis. We will consider obtaining a GI consult in the morning. We will also check an abdominal ultrasound to rule out any gallbladder disease or biliary colic.\n2. Hypertension. She will be started on labetalol 10 mg IV every 4 hours and will receive hydralazine 10 mg IV every 6 hours as needed. She will also be started on Catapres patch 0.1 mg for 24 hours.\n3. Diabetes mellitus. The patient will receive sliding scale insulin of Humalog every 6 hours while NPO. We will restart her Lantus 20 units at bedtime with supplemental sliding scale when she is tolerating a diet.\n4. Chronic renal insufficiency. Her creatinine is 2.2, which is right near her baseline of 2. We will continue to hydrate her and monitor her BMP closely.\n5. Urinary tract infection/hemorrhagic cystitis. She will be started on Cipro 400 mg IV daily. We will await the report of the abdominal ultrasound. Other things to consider would be pyelonephritis or renal stone.\n6. Obstructive sleep apnea. She will be continued on CPAP as previously ordered when she was an inpatient yesterday.\n7. Depression. We will consider a psych consult in the morning. She may have a psychological component to her nausea and vomiting.\n8. Case management to evaluate medication options. We need to make sure that she can afford all of her medications upon discharge.\nThis case was presented and thoroughly discussed with the senior resident who agrees with all medications and treatment."
