She feels she has trouble at times absorbing all that she needs to learn as far as the computer skills, protocols, customer service issues, etc. She describes the job is very demanding and high stress. She denies any history of weakness, lethargy, or dizziness. No history of stroke.",

    "Impression": "1. Short-term memory loss, probable situational.\n2. Anxiety stress issues.",
    "Plan": "Thirty-minute face-to-face appointment in counseling with the patient. At length discussion on her numerous stress issues which can certainly cause a loss of concentration and inability to learn. The current job she is at does sound extremely stressful and demanding. I think her stress reactions to these as far as feeling frustrated are within normal limits. We did complete a mini mental state exam including clock drawing, sentence writing, signature, etc. She does score a maximum score of 30/30 and all other tasks were completed without difficulty or any hesitation. I did spend quite a bit of time reassuring her as well. She is currently on Zoloft 100 mg which I think is an appropriate dose. We will have her continue on that. She did verbalize understanding and that she actually felt better after our discussion concerning these issues. At some point in time; however, I would possibly recommend job change if this one would persist as far as the stress levels. She is going to think about that."
