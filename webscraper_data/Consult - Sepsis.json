Positive bipedal edema, 2+, right worse than left.\nGASTROINTESTINAL: Globular abdomen. Soft. No guarding, no rigidity. Tender on palpation of n right upper quadrant and epigastric area. Mildly tender on palpation of right upper quadrant and epigastric area.\nLYMPHATIC: No cervical lymphadenopathy.\nSKIN: Positive diffuse jaundice. No palpable subcutaneous nodules.\nPSYCHIATRIC: Poor judgment and insight.",
    "Laboratory Data": "White blood cell count from 01/08/09 is 9 with 68% neutrophils, 20% bands, H&H 9.7/28.2, platelet count 24,000. INR 3.84, PTT more than 240. BUN and creatinine 26.8/1.2. AST 76, ALT 27, alkaline phosphatase 48, total bilirubin 17.85. Total CK 1198.6, LDH 873.2. Troponin 0.09, myoglobin 2792. Urinalysis from 01/07/09 shows small leucocyte esterase, positive nitrites, 1 to 3 wbc's, 0 to 1 rbc's, 2+ bacteria. Two sets of blood cultures from 01/07/09 still pending.",
    "Radiology": "Chest x-ray from 01/07/09 did not show any pathologic abnormalities of the heart, mediastinum, lung fields, bony or soft tissue structures. Left knee x-rays on 01/07/09 showed advanced osteoarthritis. Abdominal ultrasound on 01/07/09 showed mild-to-moderate ascites, mild prominence of the gallbladder with thickened ball and pericholecystic fluid. Preliminary report of CAT scan of the abdomen showed changes consistent to liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension with mild ascites, splenomegaly, and dilated portal/splenic and superior mesenteric vein. Appendix was not clearly seen, but there was no evidence of pericecal inflammation.",
    "Impression": "1. Septic shock.\n2. Possible urinary tract infection.\n3. Ascites, rule out spontaneous bacterial peritenonitis.\n4. Hyperbilirubinemia, consider cholangitis.\n5. Alcoholic liver disease.\n6. Thrombocytopenia.\n7. Hepatitis C.\n8. Cryoglobulinemia.",
    "Recommendations": "1. Continue with vancomycin and doripenem at this point.\n2. Agree with paracentesis.\n3. Send ascitic fluid for cell count, differential and cultures.\n4. Follow up with result of blood cultures.\n5. We will get urine culture from the specimen on admission.\n6. The patient needs hepatitis A vaccination.\nAdditional ID recommendations as appropriate upon followup."
