Patient Hi 


Doctor: thanks for coming in. letâ€™s review your diabetes treatment. You had blood tests a few days ago and your hgba1c increased much. 
Patient: ok

Doctor: tell me about your glucose measurements  
Patient: sure.  So, I got ill in December and stopped all my exercise actives. I noted the sugar increase sometimes to the 300 range. I resumed my exercises, and the glucose has improved to the 180s in the last week. 

Doctor: what illness did you get in December? 
Patient: I had a cough that would not go away.

Doctor: did you get tested for covid-19
Patient: no, I decided to not get tested. I work by myself, so I just isolated from other people.
